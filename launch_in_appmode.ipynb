    "\n",
    "[Appmode](https://github.com/oschuett/appmode) is useful for displaying Jupyter notebooks as web apps, with all the code hidden. But you can't use `appmode` within Jupyter Lab. Here's some code to create a button that launches the current notebook in `appmode`. It works in either Jupyter Lab or the classic notebook view. If `appmode` isn't available it does nothing."
